## 🧰 Backend: `app-generator/`

This Node.js backend is responsible for generating customized Flutter apps based on user form input. It processes templates, injects data, and outputs a downloadable ZIP.

### 📁 Directory Structure

```
app-generator/
├── app.js                    # Main server entry point
├── routes/
│   └── generateApp.js        # API route to handle generation requests
├── utils/
│   └── flutterGenerator.js   # Logic to replace placeholders in the Flutter template
├── templates/                # Flutter app base template
├── generated_apps/           # Output folder for ZIPs
├── package.json              # Dependencies and scripts
```

### ⚙️ Usage

```bash
cd app-generator
npm install
node app.js
```

This starts a server (typically on port `5000`) that listens for POST requests to `/generate`.

### 📦 Endpoint Example

```http
POST /generate
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "coupleName": "Aditi & Vihaan",
  "weddingDate": "2025-11-20",
  "weddingLocation": "Longwood Gardens, PA",
  "appPassword": "aditiwedsvihaan",
  ...
}
```

Returns a `.zip` file of the customized Flutter project.

### 🔌 Integration

The frontend (`wedding-app-builder`) calls this backend when the user clicks **"Generate App"**, triggering the creation of the mobile app using their personalized data.
